# Liver-Tumor-Detection

A MATLAB-based image processing project that detects and highlights liver tumors using filtering, segmentation, and edge enhancement techniques.

---

## 📖 Description
This project focuses on identifying and enhancing tumor regions in liver images using digital image processing techniques. The system converts the input liver image to grayscale, removes noise with a median filter, segments the tumor region using thresholding, applies a Butterworth filter for enhancement, and finally darkens the edges to clearly highlight the tumor area.

## 🎯 Objective
- To develop an automated liver tumor detection system using MATLAB.  
- To remove noise while preserving key image features.  
- To segment and enhance the tumor region effectively.  
- To visually emphasize tumor boundaries for better medical interpretation.

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Image acquisition – Load the liver scan image.  
2. Preprocessing – Convert to grayscale and apply median filtering.  
3. Segmentation – Use thresholding to separate the tumor region.  
4. Butterworth filtering – Enhance image details in the frequency domain.  
5. Edge enhancement – Darken tumor edges for clearer visualization.
